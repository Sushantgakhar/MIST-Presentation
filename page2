WHAT WE DO

We are committed to spread awareness about the increasing need for Information and 
Network Security. We plan to train other like minded students to enhance their skills 
and aptitude in this branch of computer science. 

The key areas we deal with are as follows:

* Cryptography (from classical techniques to DES, AES, RSA and all modern technologies)
* SQL and JS Injections
* Network Security, WEP and WPA security
* Scripting
* Penetration Testing
* Prevention of DDoS and other DoS attacks
* Prevention of Identity theft and Cyber fraud
* Prevention of malware, rootkit and virus related attacks
