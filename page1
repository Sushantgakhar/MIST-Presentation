WHO ARE WE

We are a team of Information and Network Security enthusiasts who have gathered knowledge 
about the field through workshops, online courses, books and research. We now want to 
spread the knowledge we have gained to other students with an interest in this ever-growing 
area of computer science. We want to ensure that students approach this field the right 
way and to provide them with a platform to enhance and practice their skills in the same. 
Last but not the least, we are not hackers. So if you are here with the intention of 
hacking into your ex's facebook account, I am afraid this is not the place for you.
